This final version last midifed at 24.10.2015 includes all the asked topics for the the TP2 of QT.
I tried to well comment the code so it won't be necessary to have a secondary doccument explanning
relative simple functions etc.

The program was developed using a git repository. If you want to access older versions before
the code clean and etc you can go to:
